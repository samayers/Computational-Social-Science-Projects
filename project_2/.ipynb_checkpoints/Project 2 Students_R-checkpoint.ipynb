    "Finally, there are many states accounted for the in dataset. If we convert this column to a categorical variable, and create dummies, it will create a rather sparse matrix (many 0s in our dataset) becuase there will be 49 dummy variables. One alternative is to classify each state to a larger US region and use that variable instead of state. The following code will do that."
