    "### 4.1 Describe the selected models\n",
    "\n",
    "### OLS\n",
    "OLS fits a linear model to the data that minimizes the sum of squared errors, or the sum of squared differences between the model prediction and the actual observations. OLS assumes that the true relationship between the regressors and the independent variable is linear. OLS may poorly fit the data if the true relationship is not linear. One advantage is that the coefficients from OLS are easily interpretable. Under OLS, terms have an additive correlation with the outcome of interest and a one unit change in a regressor has the same effect on the outcome no matter the level of the regressor. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RIDGE\n",
    "Similar to OLS, ridge regression fits a linear model (technically it does not need to be linear as you could have ridge for logit or other non-linear models). The objective function of the ridge regression is to minimize the sum of squared residuals plus a term that depends on the absolute size of each coeffcient subject to a tuning parameter. In essence, this prevents any coefficient $\\beta_j$ from being too large if the relevant predictor does not explain a sufficient amount of the variation in the outcome variable. Overall, this has the effect of minimizing the coefficients on unimportant predictors which reduces overfitting. One con to ridge regression is that coefficients are less interpretable. Also, the ridge regression will include all the covariates in the final estimate instead of just including the important covariates as opposed to LASSO. Additionally, the ridge regression will introduce bias into the coefficient estimates. Some predictors may not explain a significant portion of the variation in the outcome, but nonethless may be important correlates between a specific predictor of interest and the outcome simultaneously. This will bias the causal interpretation of the coefficient on that predictor of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LASSO\n",
    "The LASSO works similar to the ridge regression in that it minimizes the sum of squared residuals subject to a penalty on the size of the coefficients. But where the ridge regression penalizes the squared size of the coefficients, the LASSO penalizes the absolute size. Because the absolute value has a kink at 0, many potential predictors do not explain sufficient variation in the outcome to justify their inclusion in the model. This often results in LASSO only selecting a subset of the potential predictors. Similar to ridge, the coefficients on the LASSO are less interpretable than OLS and the use of regularization introduces extra bias as the cost of lowering the out-of-sample variance in predictions."

Using both the test and validation sets helps to ensure that our out of sample error rate is adequate enough to justify using the algorithm for policy decisions."

Implementing a CV approach to find the best lambda is a bad idea if we are concerned about specifying the correct model or saying something causal about diabetes prevalance. This is because a CV-selected lambda will optimize the prediction power of the model, but may shrink coefficients on important variables to zero. Here, we are only concerned with predicting the rate of diabetes in a county. Using a cross-validation approach to select the tuning parameter is appropriate."

    "### Choosing number of folds for cross validation\n",
    "The choice of folds when performing k-fold cross validation is a trade-off between bias and variance. The more folds there are, the fewer observations there will be in each fold. When the data is trained on K-1 folds with large k, the k-1 folds will contain most of the training data. Containing more data means that the bias will be lower as the algorithm can more accurately fit the data. However, this means that overfitting may be a problem as large k more closely approximates a leave-one-out cross validation approach where prediction on the single observation that is left out may suffer from high variance as any single observation may not be typical of the underlying distribtion of data.\n",

    "### 6.1 What is the bias-variance tradeoff? Why is it relevant to machine learning poblems like this one?\n",
    "You can decrease bias, or the degree to which the fitted values of your model differ from the actual values, by incorporating more information, or predictors, into your model. Doing this in a sample, there is some degree to which you are capturing the way the real world works, and some degree to which you are explaining random variation in your particular sample. If you include lots of predictors that explain random variation, then your predcition model will not be consitent when you use it on other samples since those new samples will have random variation that looks very different from your original data. This is is the bias-variance trade-off. This is relevant to machine learning because we care about creating prediction models that capture the way the world truly works, and that give us consistent and accurate predictions across models."

    "### 6.2 Define overfitting, and why it matters for machine learning. How can we address it?\n",
    "Overfitting is tailoring your estimate of a model to fit the idiosyncracies of a particular dataset that are a product of random error or potentially measurment error rather than the underlying data generating process. In the context of diabetes, we might think of diabetes as caused primarily by diet, exercise, and genetic factors. However, we may, by random chance, get a sample of data on diabetes prevalence that happens to contain lots of individuals who are accounttants and have diabetes. This does not mean that diabetes is caused by becoming an accountant. This is just a feature of the particular sample we happened to draw. Overfitting in this particular example means that we fit a model that uses being an accountant as a strong predictor of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we are primarily concenred with prediction. In our toy example, our model is unlikely to predict diabetes well when we apply it to other datasets because being an accountant has no direct link with diabetes. In practice, the random noise we get in any given dataset is likely to be more subtle than the accountant example. Nevertheless, our algorithm may chase down this random noise rather than focusing on information that truly predicts our outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way to address overfitting is to average models over many many samples. If we take multiple samples, the idisyncracies from any one sample will eventually cancel each other out. Some samples may have lots of accountants with diabetes leading to a model that uses being an accountant as an improtant predictor of diabetes. Other samples may have very few accountants and will conclude this is not an improtant predictor. Other samples may have lots of accountants who do not have diabetes and conclude being an accountant is a protective factor. By averaging these the predictions across these samples together, the noise (being an accountant) will not being given much weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to prevent overfitting is to only place weight on predictors that expalin a significant amount of variation in the outcome, this is regularization. Being an accountant may explain some variation in diabetes in a given sample, but it is unlikely to explain that much. Regularization will help to produce a model where predictors that explain small pockets of noise are given little to no improtance for prediction.\n",

    "According to the algorithm, predictors like the obesity and physcial activity number, as well as whether the county is in the South or Southeast are indicative of higher diabetes rates. It would be natural to pilot the programs in these areas. However, we know the actual diabetes rate and we are interested in preventing diabetes. It would likely be best to prioritize piloting the program in areas where obesity and physical inactivity are increasing, but where diabetes is not necessarily high as these factors may be leading predictors of diabetes. However, the algorithm does not tell us this and certainly does not tell us the causal relationship between diabetes and these factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Race, gender, and age are important predictors of diabetes rates according to the algorithm, the ommision or inclusion of these predictors would likely change how accurate the algorithm is at predicting diabetes rates. While this algorithm is a good start for predciting diabetes rates, it does not predict future diabetes rates or factors that cause diabetes that might be changeable through the prevention program. Consequently, it would be better to run this algorithm on panel data and to know more about the design of the prevention problem. That being said, if we truly need to a contemporaneous predictor of diabetes rates, this algorithm may be our best availble option."
